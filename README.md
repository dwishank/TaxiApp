# TaxiApp
This was my 2nd year College project where I have tried to implement the Taxi booking app just like an Uber



So The basic idea here is that There are two ways to register for the app 
1) As a Driver
2) As a Customer

InApp Adverisents have also been provided in general .

As per the apple guidelines it is extremely important to basically take the user permissions before accessing the app so This has also been doen using info.plist where I have take the permission.


Now once the customer sends the request now he would basically call an uber

Now the driver table would get updated as follows

The driver choses the ride and accepts the ride.
